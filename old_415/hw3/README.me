##Homework 3 : Cops and Robbers

Sadly, I don't currently have the PDF for this game. The overall premise is an 8x8 grid where the police and thief are, with the thief at a specific location and the police moving to catch him. If this is done within a specified range of moves (5 more than the minimum) you win.

# CMPE-415-UMBC
### old 415
Beginner FPGA class projects. Documentation is sketchy or nonexistent. 
Mainly here for personal storage, but if you want to look at them go ahead.
Note that they aren't particularly good though.

### Links
Various links of interest w.r.t. Verilog and FPGA design

### Beginner FPGAs
A list of FPGAs for those who want to get more involved in FPGA design. Prices range from 60$ to 350$.


### Free Student Software I want to try personally

https://www.sigasi.com/try-form-edu/ - Sigasi IDE. VHDL only. I've heard great things and have been doing VHDL mostly lately. May be in your best interest to practice VHDL since every DoD company around MD uses it

https://www.mentor.com/company/higher_ed/modelsim-student-edition - Modelsim is an awesome simulator, but it only works on 32-bits and is a bit jumpy on Linux. It's great on Windows though. It's best used if you know how to run .do scripts

https://www.aldec.com/en/products/fpga_simulation/active_hdl_student - I actually have this one and haven't used it much. It's a little more involved than Modelsim, but the GUI is way better.

MATLAB Student Edition - It's free at UMBC. Those of you who don't understand what this has to do with FPGAs have much to learn.

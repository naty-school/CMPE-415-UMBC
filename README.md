# CMPE-415-UMBC
### old 415
Beginner FPGA class projects. Documentation is sketchy or nonexistent. 
Mainly here for personal storage, but if you want to look at them go ahead.
Note that they aren't particularly good though.

### Links

https://eclipse.umbc.edu/robucci/cmpe415/ - old 415 site, useful for reference.

https://github.com/Digilent?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Nexys&type=&language= - Digilent Nexys Demos. If you like this stuff and find it fun, spend some time on these. They're out-of-box fully functional and will teach you stuff. FYI the Nexys A7 and DDR4 are effectively the same board

TRUST ME THIS IS IMPORTANT. I know these can be annoying, but until you've experienced race condition hell you don't understand www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2000SJ_NBA.pdf

https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse370/09wi/ - I really like this course, but you can't access some stuff you need to do the tutorials as presented and need to adjust them

### Free Student Software I want to try personally
https://www.sigasi.com/try-form-edu/ - Sigasi IDE. VHDL only. I've heard great things and have been doing VHDL mostly lately. May be in your best interest to practice VHDL since every DoD company around MD uses it
https://www.mentor.com/company/higher_ed/modelsim-student-edition - Modelsim is an awesome simulator, but it only works on 32-bits and is a bit jumpy on Linux. It's great on Windows though. It's best used if you know how to run .do scripts
https://www.aldec.com/en/products/fpga_simulation/active_hdl_student - I actually have this one and haven't used it much. It's a little more involved than Modelsim, but the GUI is way better.
